During the program's development, two main challenges will emerge: firstly, managing the alignment of threads, and secondly, the computer's processing capacity. If certain actions are delayed, the traffic pattern could become congested, increasing the risk of accidents. To mitigate this risk, concurrent programming must be executed with precision, and the computer's processing power needs to be enhanced.
